# JUCE-HEAVY DEMO
This is a [JUCE](https://juce.com) Demo Project showing how to connect with Heavy C++ (shortform `HVCC`) generated Source files.
The Demo includes a minimal synthesizer created with PureData/PlugData which was then compiled with [HVCC](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc). A connection between the Heavy parameters and JUCE is done via JUCE's `AudioProcessor APVTS` parameter management.



## How does it work?
In `ParamIds.h` you have to double the Hashs/Parameters generated by the Heavy Compiler to connect them to APVTS. In the case of this demo you see the Parameters created by Heavy in the `Heavy_Simple_OSC.h` file.
This Project uses the `JUCE` generic editor by default because it's very handy for quick tests. But if you cange to `HeavyTutorialAudioProcessorEditor` in HeavyTutorialAudioProcessor::createEditor(), you can start with designing your own GUI right away, some basics are already there.
The PureData Source File `Simple-OSC.pd` is included in the root folder of the Project. It works with PlugData, but won't work with Vanilla, as it uses a Reverb created with Heavy. The C files created by Heavy are in the Folder `Source/HeavyFiles`.



## Why would I need this?
`HVCC` compiles Plugins for different formats already: LV2, VST2, VST3, Clap, Jack ... 
BUT, if you want to create your own `GUI`, you need to spend some extra work, like to create a unique GUI with JUCE.
JUCE also gives you the possibility to create Projects for a huge variety of plattforms. You can create Apps for iOS or Android Devices for example, which is not possible with many other crossplatform audio frameworks.

For the Mobile Version you will take the Xcode iOS Exporter.<br /> To make it work on your iOS device change the `Development Team ID` to yours.

This project will create the ports for Standalone, VST3 and AUv3, but you can go other directions of course.
