# JUCE-HEAVY Template
This is a Demo / Template JUCE Project showing how to connect JUCE with Heavy C++ (shortform "HVCC") generated Source files.
A [JUCE](https://juce.com) Demo / Template including a minimal synthesizer created with PureData/PlugData and then compiled with [HVCC](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc), that connects the Heavy parameters with JUCE's AudioProcessor APVTS parameter management.


## How does it work?
In ParamIds you have to double Hashs generate by the Heavy Compiler. In the case of this demo that's in the Heavy_Simple_OSC.h file.
