# JUCE-HEAVY DEMO
This is a [JUCE](https://juce.com) Demo Project showing how to connect with Heavy C++ (shortform `HVCC`) generated Source files.
The Demo includes a minimal synthesizer created with PureData/PlugData which was then compiled with [HVCC](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc). A connection between the Heavy parameters and JUCE is done via JUCE's `AudioProcessor APVTS` parameter management.



## How does it work?
In `ParamIds.h` you have to double the Hashs/Parameters generated by the Heavy Compiler to connect them to APVTS. In the case of this demo you see the Parameters created by Heavy in the `Heavy_Simple_OSC.h` file.
This Project uses the `JUCE` generic editor by default because it's very handy for quick tests. But if you cange to `HeavyTutorialAudioProcessorEditor` in HeavyTutorialAudioProcessor::createEditor(), you can start with designing your own GUI right away, some basics are already there.
The PureData Source File `Simple-OSC.pd` is included in the root folder of the Project. It works with PlugData, but won't work with Vanilla, as it uses a Reverb created with Heavy. The C files created by Heavy are in the Folder `Source/HeavyFiles`.



## Why would I need this?
`HVCC` compiles Plugins for different formats already: LV2, VST2, VST3, Clap, Jack ... 
BUT, if you want to create your own `GUI`, you need to spend some extra work, like to create a unique GUI with JUCE.
JUCE also gives you the possibility to create Projects for a huge variety of plattforms. You can create Apps for iOS or Android Devices for example, which is not possible with many other crossplatform audio frameworks.
